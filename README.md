# AI Ready Life

**20 AI plugins. Every life domain. Private. On your machine.**

Built by [fru.dev](https://fru.dev)

AI Ready Life packages your most important life domains as installable plugins — each one a self-contained expert with its own skills, vault, and AI integration. Start with one domain. Add more as needed.

Works with **Claude Desktop / Claude Code** and **Codex CLI**. Install in either ecosystem from the same repo.

## Bundles

| Bundle | Includes | Gumroad |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Core | health + wealth + tax + career | [frudev.gumroad.com/l/aireadylife-core](https://frudev.gumroad.com/l/aireadylife-core) |
| Complete | All 20 domains | [frudev.gumroad.com/l/aireadylife-complete](https://frudev.gumroad.com/l/aireadylife-complete) |

## How It Works

Each plugin has two parts:

**1. The vault** — your personal data, stored locally on your machine.

```
~/Documents/aireadylife/vault/
├── health/
│   ├── config.md       ← your profile and settings
│   ├── 00_current/     ← active documents
│   ├── 01_prior/       ← historical records
│   └── 02_briefs/      ← generated reports
├── wealth/
├── tax/
└── ...
```

**2. The plugin** — installed in Claude Desktop, reads your vault and runs skills against it.

```
~/Documents/aireadylife/domains/
├── health/             ← installed from this repo
├── wealth/
└── ...
```

## Setup

### Step 1 — Get your vault template

Purchase the vault template for your domain on Gumroad. Each domain has its own listing at `frudev.gumroad.com/l/aireadylife-{domain}`.

Unzip the download and place the vault folder at the correct path for your OS:

| OS | Path |
|----|------|
| **Mac** | `~/Documents/aireadylife/vault/{domain}/` |
| **Windows** | `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\aireadylife\vault\{domain}\` |

Open `config.md` and fill in your details.

### Step 2 — Install the plugin

Pick your AI tool:

#### Option A — Claude Desktop / Claude Code

1. Open Claude Desktop → Settings → Integrations
2. Add this GitHub repo as a project source: `fru-dev3/AI-Ready-Life`
3. Set your project folder:
   - **Mac:** `~/Documents/aireadylife/`
   - **Windows:** `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\aireadylife\`

The plugin reads your vault automatically via the path in `config.md`.

> **Mac only:** If Claude can't access your vault, go to System Settings → Privacy & Security → Full Disk Access and add Claude, then restart.
> **Windows:** No additional access configuration needed.

#### Option B — Codex CLI

Requires Codex CLI 0.125.0 or later (`brew upgrade --cask codex` if needed).

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add fru-dev3/AI-Ready-Life
codex                # start the interactive session
/plugins             # browse the marketplace, select a domain, hit Install
```

The marketplace manifest lives at `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` and exposes all 20 domains. Install one or many from the `/plugins` panel. Skills auto-discover after install; if a new skill doesn't appear, restart Codex.

### Step 3 — Run your first skill

In Claude or Codex, try:

```
Give me a health brief
What's my net worth?
Am I on track with my taxes?
Review my career pipeline
```

## Vault Templates

Vault templates are sold separately on Gumroad. Each template includes:

- `config.md` — blank profile ready to fill in
- `00_current/` — your active working folder
- `01_prior/` — organized by year (2023, 2024, 2025)
- `02_briefs/` — where the agent writes its reports
- `get-started/QUICKSTART.md` — setup guide
- `get-started/PROMPTS.md` — ready-to-use prompt library
